      <h3 class="fancy">Hey There!</h3>

      <p>I'm Tiffany Summerford and I'm a software developer from the Greater Boston Area who has a passion for fashion!</p>

      <p>As an ecologically conscious person, I strongly believe in recycling and sometimes even repurposing old clothing. You'll often find me in a thrift store scouring through racks of clothing. Believe it or not, being a thrifty individual requires some talent. For example:</p>

        <ol>
          <li>Having a creative eye.</li>
          <li>Being resourceful.</li>
          <li>Perseverance and patience.</li>
        </ol>

    <h3>About</h3>
      <p>
        As a former sales assistant I found myself with too much time on my hands (...boring!). So, I took the time to figure out exactly what I wanted to do with my future. After much research and self-reflection, I decided I wanted to start learning how to design websites.
      </p>
      
      <p>
        I've always been interested in learning and figuring out ways to progress my brain. <i>I know </i> joining a career that requires constant mental maintenance and problem-solving skills is right up my alley.
      </p>

      <p>
        Since starting at Thinkful, I've found learning new programming languages very similar to playing chess. Which, I high-key love playing chess and other problem-solving games of the like.
